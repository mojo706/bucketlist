# Buckets : A Bucketlist API
 
## Introduction
A Bucket List is a list of things that one has not done before but wants to do before dying. Bonne Vie is an api for online bucket list service using Flask. Buckets allows you to interact with an api and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the bucket list.
 
## Installation
 
#### Clone Buckets GitHub repo:
 

`>>> git clone https://github.com/mojo706/bucketlist.git`

#### cd into the created folder create a virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper

`>>> mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python3 cp-bucketlist `

#### Activate the virtual environment

`>>> workon cp-bucketlist`

#### Use pip to install all the app requirements

`>>> pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Create the database and run migrations

`>>> createdb bucketlist_api`

`>>> python manage.py db init`

`>>> python manage.py db migrate`

`>>> python manage.py db upgrade`   

#### For testing use the same process but with a different database eg. 

`>>> createdb test_db`

`>>> python manage.py db init`

`>>> python manage.py db migrate`

`>>> python manage.py db upgrade` 

#### All done! Now, start your server by running `>>> python manage.py runserver`. Use [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to make requests to the api.
